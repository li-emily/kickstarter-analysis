# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get us familiar with using Excel and PivotTables, as well as working with some data that is relatively straightforward. We were able to learn more about specific Excel functions, getting used to using data and basic statistics (such as standard deviation, mean, and median), representing data through visual charts and graphs, and managing as well as referencing multiple individual worksheets inside a Excel workbook.

## Analysis

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
