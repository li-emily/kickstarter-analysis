# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get us familiar with using Excel and PivotTables, as well as working with some data that is relatively straightforward. We were able to learn more about specific Excel functions, getting used to using data and basic statistics (such as standard deviation, mean, and median), representing data through visual charts and graphs, and managing as well as referencing multiple individual worksheets inside a Excel workbook. 

## Analysis
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on Launch Date, it seemd that there were the most theater Kickstarters launched in May, June, July, and August.  However, not all of these months were equally successful. May had both the overall most Kickstarters launched, as well as the most successful Kickstarters as well, with 111 out of 166. However, most months had at least above a 60% success rate, excluding January, August, October, and the least successful month, December. Notably, December's success rate is just above 49%, around 7% lower than October. Overall, there were few theater campaigns canceled throughout the year; the range of cancelations by month went from 0 to only 7.

Based on the graph, you can see the spike in successful Kickstarter campaigns from late spring winding down into early summer. Additionally, the number of failed campaigns is much less varied compared to the successful outcomes, and canceled campaigns is a relatively small footnote.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
